1) render some component on screen
2) here for post list 
 i) post list component should get list from that json api inorder to show itself correctly
 ii) for this we need to to define componentdidmount lifecycle method in our class (thats why we usong class based componeny method to get access to lifecycle methods)
3)inside of componentdidmount ----> we call actioncreator  so whenever post list component initially shows up on the screem that action creartor is going to  automaticaaly called
4)action creator we puuting will have code a(lis of blog post)
6)after that action creator will return an 'action' 
7) action object will have our fetched data on our payload property 
8) dispatch method will dipatch that action and send it to all the reducers 
9) reducers sees this action and it will pull of just that dat afromthe payload property 
10) anytime reducers run they r going to return some values 
11) those values are going to form a new state object inside of a redux store 
12) any time reducers  run and produce a new state object-----> we gonna take that state and we going to sent off 
into the react side of our application.--->and redux and reaxt-redux are going to cause the react app to rerender

13)so this time around we going to have list of post in the stateobject
14) use mapstatetoprops fucntion  to get lus of post out of aur global state object into our postlistcomponent



action creator camel case fetchPosts
component name capital   PostLists
