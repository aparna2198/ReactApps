reducers are called with two arguments
1) previous state (state1) (data) initially at first we givee this as null value  reducername(reducernamesomevalue=null,action)
2) action 
  
and in turn we get new state  state 2(suppose)


and in betwee this we are not  suppose to make an api request or to read a file from a hardrive or solicit the user for some input or to reach the dom and pull out a value  (BAADDD) 

when reduecer is called  it should only look at the previous state and action object to decide what to return 


MUTATIONS:
any time i change the contents of the array it is refered to as mutation
in js strings and numbers are immutable values we cannot change them  in the same way we can easily change array,object 
ONE OF FTH ERULES OF REDUCERS Is : must not mutate its state arguments
but in last app where we sent selectedsong as the state which changes(mutates) as the user selects diff songs

we need to find good ways of manipulating the state instead of mutating them
eg:[...colours,"red"] instead of colours.push("red")
