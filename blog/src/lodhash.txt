lodhash is utility javascript library

has many fucntion built into it that makes writing javascript easy 

memoize is a one of the fucntionss
function getUser(id){
fetch(id);
return "made  a request"
}

const memoizedGetUser=_.memoize(getUser)
memoizedGetUser is the same function as getuser except for
we can call memoizedGetUser only one time with any unqiue set of argument
after we call it one time  we can still call it but the original function  is not going to be invoked
instead memoize  will returnd whatever it returned previously the last time we ran it with the identical set of arguments
