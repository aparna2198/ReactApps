now basically after dispatch we use middleware  and then to reducer
inside redux app we can have as many or as few middleware as possible 


middelware is a plain javascript fucntion 

which u call when every single action that you dispatch 

inside of that function middleware has the opportunity  to stop an action 

middleware is most populr for deaoling with asynchornous action creators

we using React-thunk middleware to deal with async issues 



how redux thunk does the job?

generally action creators return ----> action & payload(optional)
but here instead of this
redux thunk allows the action creator to return FUNCTIONS thatssss instead

and when u do returna  fucntion redux Thunk automatically invokes that function

invokes the fucntion with dispatch and getState --> these tow are the same we  sw in code pen

we then wait for our request to finish(api request) 

request complete dispatch action MANUALLY(thats the key) and update data inside of our store
